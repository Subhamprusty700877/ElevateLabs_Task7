DATA ANALYST INTERNSHIP TASK 7

First, a database file (sales_data.db) is created with some sample sales records. 
Then, a Python script connects to the database, runs an SQL query to calculate the total 
quantity sold and total revenue for each product, and displays the results in a table. 
It also creates a simple bar chart showing the revenue per product using matplotlib. 
The project uses Python’s built-in sqlite3 module for database work, pandas for handling data, and matplotlib for visualization. 
Running the scripts is simple — one script sets up the database, and another fetches and visualizes the data, making it a quick and easy way to practice combining SQL and Python for basic data analysis.
